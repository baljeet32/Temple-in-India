The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Bahaii
 House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.
Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent 
attraction in the city. Like all Bahaii Houses of Worship, 
the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or 
any other qualification. The building is composed of 27 
free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of 
three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a 
central hall with a height of slightly over 34.27 metres
and a capacity of 2,500 people. The Lotus Temple has won 
numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many 
newspaper and magazine articles. A 2001 CNN report referred
 to it as the most visited building in the world.
The Bahaii Faith teaches that a Bahaii House of Worship should
 be a space for people of all religions to gather, reflect, and
 worship.Anyone may enter the Lotus Temple irrespective of 
religious background, sex, or other distinctions, as is the 
case with all Bahaii houses of worship.

Badrinath or Badrinarayan Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated
 to Lord Vishnu which is situated in the town of Badrinath in 
Uttarakhand, India. The temple and town form one of the four 
Char Dham and Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. The temple is 
also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is 
worshipped as Badrinath—holy shrines for Vaishnavites. It is 
open for six months every year (between the end of April and 
the beginning of November), because of extreme weather 
conditions in the Himalayan region. The temple is located in
 Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of 
Alaknanda River at an elevation of 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above
 the mean sea level. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage
 centers of India, having recorded 1,060,000 visits.

The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple 
is a 1 ft (0.30 m), the black stone statue of Vishnu in the
 form of Badrinarayan. The statue is considered by many 
Hindus to be one of eight swayam vyakta kshetras, or self-
manifested statues of Vishnu.

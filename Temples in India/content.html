<td><font size=5px >Hindu temple is a symbolic house, seat and body of divinity.
 It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, 
using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism.
 The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions
, deploying circles and squares. It also represents recursion and 
equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers,
 and by "specific alignments related to the geography of the place and 
the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron".</font></td>

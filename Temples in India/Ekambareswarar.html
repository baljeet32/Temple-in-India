Ekambareswarar temple is one of the five Hindu temples dedicated 
to Lord Shiva and is located in Kanchipuram in the southern state 
of Tamil Nadu. The five Shiva temples represent a primordial natural 
element – water, ether, fire, wind – with the Ekambareswarar temple 
representing earth.
This vast temple is famous for its huge ‘Gopuram’ which dominates the 
skyline of the temple town of Kanchipuram. This town is among the 
seven most important pilgrimage centres in India and attracts numerous 
tourists. The temple gains further significance as it’s historically 
among the most ancient temples, with its existence dating back to around 
600 AD. This sprawling temple covers an area of more than 40 acres and 
reaches a maximal height of 57 meters. The temple’s main entrance – the 
‘Raja Gopuram’ is among the tallest in South India and is carved with 
graceful art forms and sculptures in various poses. It was built by Raja 
Krishna Deva Raya and the intricate designing of this gopuram can keep 
connoisseurs of art entranced for hours.
